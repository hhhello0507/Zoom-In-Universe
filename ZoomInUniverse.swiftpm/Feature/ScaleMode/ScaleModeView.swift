            answer: "Inside a black hole, gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. Scientists believe that space and time behave differently inside the event horizon."

            question: "What would happen if Earth had two suns?",
            answer: "Earthâ€™s climate would be dramatically different, with extreme heat, longer days, and possibly no nighttime in some regions. Life as we know it might not exist!"

            question: "Could we ever live on Mars?",

            question: "What is the coldest place in the universe?",

            id: 11,
            question: "How small can we go?",

            id: 13,
            question: "Can we see atoms?",

        .init(
            id: 14,
            question: "What did the universe look like before the Big Bang?",
            answer: "No one knows for sure! Some theories suggest a previous universe collapsed and gave birth to ours in a cycle called the Big Bounce."
        ),
        .init(
            id: 15,
            question: "Will time ever stop?",
            answer: "If the universe expands forever and loses all energy, time itself might eventually become meaningless in a distant future called the Heat Death."
        ),
        .init(
            id: 16,
            question: "Can I see what Earth looked like millions of years ago?",
            answer: "Yes! Light from distant galaxies takes millions of years to reach us, so when we look at the night sky, weâ€™re literally looking back in time."
        ),
        .init(
            id: 17,
            question: "What if I fell into a black hole?",

            id: 18,
            question: "Can I hear sound in space?",
            answer: "Space is a vacuum, so sound canâ€™t travel. However, NASA has converted space signals into eerie sound waves!"

            question: "Whatâ€™s the strangest exoplanet ever discovered?",

            id: 20,
            question: "Are there more planets or stars in the universe?",
